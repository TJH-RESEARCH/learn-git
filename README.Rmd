## Learning Git R Project

This project is to serve as an example while I learn git at a deeper level. 

I will be study along with Happy Git and GitHub for the useR https://happygitwithr.com

The first 2 sections (Chapter 1-19) are a little too basic for me. 

### git diff

I've just made these changes to the markdown: adding the git diff heading, and writing this sentence. I haven't staged or committed this yet. Now I'll run `git diff`. 

It shows the changes. Once I stage this changed file, git diff will again show no changes.

To view differences between what is in the staging and what is already committed, enter `git diff --staged`. `git diff --cached` is an alias for `git diff --staged`.

The `-w` flag will tell `git diff` to ignore whitespace changes.

`git diff` can also show the differences between two different commits. 

To view a log of previous commits, use `git log`
